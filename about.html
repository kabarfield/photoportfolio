    <p>HELLO! 
      MY NAME IS ALI, I'M THE GIRL BEHIND THE CAMERA.
      <br>
      <br>
    
      I'M SO GLAD YOU STOPPED BY MY SITE! GRAB A CUP OF TEA AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
      <br>
      <br>

      If you clicked this page wanting to get to know me better than you're in luck! Here's a few little details about me in a nutshell:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Photography is my biggest passion and though I take it seriously, I like to have a lot of fun during sessions.
      <br>
      2. I started my business as a sophomore in high school.
     <br>
      3. I moved to NYC August 2017 for college to study journalism and fashion marketing.
      <br>
      <br>

      If you want to know even more, here's an expansion! My middle name isn't actually May, that's the month I was born in! I’ve always had a passion for being creative and expressing this through art. I loved drawing and painting until I discovered the world of photography. I began to get serious about photography a couple years ago when I got my first DSLR camera. I did a photography challenge where I took a photo every day for a year and that was when I really saw the magic in capturing those little moments in time that could never be recreated. Ever since then I’ve been photographing friends, families, newlyweds and everything in between. 
      <br>
      <br>

      I’m a lover of coffee and tea. I am completely full of wanderlust and love traveling around the world, from small trips to grand adventures. My favorite part of those adventures is the company. I love the people I travel with and get to meet. Though I was based in NC, I now live in NYC but am available for travel anywhere you are! 
      <br>
      <br>

      I’m so lucky to get to document your moments whether you’re a giddy senior, newly engaged lovebirds or you’re walking down the aisle. I’m here to help you tell your story! 
      <br>
      <br>

      Thank you for taking a look into my world! I can’t wait to be a part of yours. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Feel free to contact me to just say hello or ask for more information about a session!</p>
